# BSR Light Controller Instructions

## Changing the batteries:
-	**Battery orientation is important!** If the batteries are put in incorrectly the magick smoke will be released and the controller will die.
-	When the batteries are swapped, sometimes the controller needs to be initialized to function.  Plug in a powered micro-USB charging cable until the red lights come on.  After unplugging the USB port use the power button on the side to turn on.  (Charge ports are highlighted in red, and power button is highlighted in green.)
-	When installing fresh batteries always put the spent ones back in the charger so they are ready for the next swap.

## Operation:
- The switch has three positions:
    - Middle:  Off
    - Side 1: Steady green
        -	When in steady green, the knob controls brightness.
    - Side 2: Pulsing
        - When pulsing, the knob controls the speed.
    - The button is the History Eraser Button.  Do not press.
- Charge ports are highlighted in red, and are only used to re-initialize the charge controller.  Charging of batteries should be done in the dedicated charger.
- Power button is highlighted in green.
